<h1> Our Purpose</h1>

<p> 
  The purpose of this webpage is to educate the public about the affects of pollution on our environment, what increases pollution, and how we can all contribute in reducing air and environmental pollution one step at a time.
<br/>
<br/>

We want to spread environmental awareness, but what is environmental awareness?
Environmental awareness is awareness about our surounding natural environment and how our choices either promote the well being of the environment or contribute to its harm.
<br/>
Environmental awareness is very important because it spreads the right information about how human pollution is affecting the plane we live in. Glaciers are melting at an alarming rate, sever droughts are more common, and as a result droughts and floods become much more severe. This affects not only the environment, but living beings including humans as well. And this is just one example out of the hundreds of damages greenhouse gases are causing.
